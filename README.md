👋 Hey there, I'm David Warner II, your friendly neighborhood tech enthusiast! 🚀

🏢 Currently rocking the Microsoft MVP life (Most Valuable Professional). 😎

🏆 Proud winner of the 2019 Microsoft Dev Kitchen, where I cooked up some seriously awesome tech. 🍳

🎤 As a seasoned public speaker, I've been privileged to be on the stages of the Microsoft 365 Conference and the European Power Platform Conference as a keynote speaker. Additionally, I've been honored to speak at numerous domestic and international community events, sharing insights and ideas with tech enthusiasts worldwide. 🌍

💻 When I'm not tinkering with drones or diving into the depths of video development, you'll find me knee-deep in software development trenches. From SharePoint Framework to Power Platform, I'm a huge fan of all things JavaScript, HTML, CSS, TypeScript, Power Apps, Power Automate, Power Pages and PowerShell. 💡

🎨 Speaking of creativity, I'm also a graphic design and multimedia fan, wielding Adobe Photoshop, Audition, and After Effects like a digital Picasso. 🎬

🌐 As a proud member of the [Microsoft Patterns and Practices Team](http://aka.ms/community/home), I'm all about community engagement. Hosting [Microsoft Community Calls](https://aka.ms/community/calls), kicking off "[Sharing is Caring](https://aka.ms/sharing-is-caring)" initiatives with [Hugo Bernier](https://www.github.com/hugoabernier), and championing the "[Microsoft Recognition Program](https://aka.ms/community/recognition)" are just a few ways I spread the tech love. 🧡💜

🏈 Oh, did I mention I'm a die-hard Vikings fan? SKOL! 🏒 And when I'm not cheering on my team, you'll catch me enjoying the thrill of hockey or lending my voice-over talents to projects for Microsoft, [Audible](https://www.audible.com/search?searchNarrator=David+Warner+II&ref_pageloadid=not_applicable&ref=a_pd_Your-F_c1_narrator_1&pf_rd_p=df6bf89c-ab0c-4323-993a-2a046c7399f9&pf_rd_r=PSN2SVBPVXN69246MHQR&pageLoadId=PgsjtDH4gLVyWNWY&creativeId=16015ba4-2e2d-4ae3-93c5-e937781a25cd), and more. 🎙️

Let's connect and geek out together! 🤓 💜🧡
